Data Sharing Agreement for the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog 
===

*This Data Sharing Agreement has been modeled from the Data Sharing Agreement for the Atlantic 
Offshore Seabird Compendium drafted by USGS.  The Data Sharing agreement provides guidance to 
data contributors of the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog (NWASC). “Community of Users” refers 
to researchers, coastal planners, agencies and others interested in using these data, including 
those studying impacts of wind energy on birds using offshore waters.*  

**Sharing Policy for Data Owners and Contributors**

- I am contributing information about my seabird survey data to the NWASC, 
a shared repository, for the purposes of making the information more broadly 
available and useful for the Community of Users. 
- I am providing information about my surveys to the NWASC at a level I am 
comfortable with sharing with the Community of Users. The levels of information 
will be determined by what I provide:  
  - all of my data, including observations  
  - general information and spatial survey data (tracks, points, dates; but no observations)  
  - only general information about my program  
- I understand that users will see the data use agreement for the NWASC; however data may 
also be shared through other “portals” such as OBIS or AKN, and in some of those cases, 
the use policy may not appear as directly as it does here. Those portals may have their 
own policies, e.g. [OBIS](http://www.iobis.org/data/policy/).  
- I understand because my data may be disseminated to other data portals, I may not be aware when data are accessed.  
- I understand that by depositing my data in the NWASC, some editing may occur. Edits may be required 
by the database manager for consistency across datasets in the repository, or for quality control reasons.   
- I understand that as a data owner or contributor, I can also download my data including any edits.  
- I agree that if I learn of significant errors in a contributed dataset, I will notify the database manager or contact person.  
- By providing my email address, I am allowing members of the Community of Users to contact me regarding 
availability or other questions with this dataset.  
- To protect the publication rights of contributors, I understand that the database manager 
may disallow download of my observational data until two years after the date of data collection. 
However I also understand that all data may be requested via FOIA request, and that the database 
manager will readily comply with such requests. Knowing this, I understand that I may hold truly 
sensitive data out of the repository.  

Please also be aware of the Data Use Agreement and 
[Submission Guidelines](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/Submission%20Guidelines%20for%20NWASC.rmd) for data contributors.
