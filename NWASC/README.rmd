# **Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog - Read Me** 

Details can be found at the FWS [website](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/), only FWS personnel can view this website. 
Currently the working version of the database is in PostgreSQL and can only be accessed from non-FWS computers. The long term goal is to 
create a new database in Microsoft SQL server, which can be run on FWS computers. This might be a simple client switch or might involve a 
database redesign. Other updates on the progree of this endeavor can be read in the BOEM bimonthly progress reports for this project.

### **1. Collect datasets at large**   
This is an ongoing effort by FWS, NOAA, and BOEM. A progress table can be seen [here](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/progress-table)

### **2. Quality control data**  
This will most likely be simple data checks (e.g. do species codes match those in the catalog) - data should be cleaned by the data provider before submission

### **3. Enter data into the database**  
There are several tables in the seabird schema; however, the most important ones are the observations and transect tables. 
Track data is stored in the QGIS spatial portion of PostgreSQL. 

### **4. Check database integrity**  
After adding data, you should verify that the joins were successful.

### **5. Submit data to users and archives**  
- NODC
- OBIS
- BISON
- AKN
- NOAA
  - The NOAA Biogeography branch uses all of the data in the catalog in a predictive distribution model. 
  This involves processing all of the seabird data into segments. See segmentation script. 

### **6. Handle data requests**  
Anyone can request the data. These requests will most likely be specific and require querying the database
