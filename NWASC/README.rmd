# **Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog - Read Me** 

Details can be found at the FWS [website](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/), only FWS personnel can view this website. 
Currently the working version of the database is in PostgreSQL and can only be accessed from non-FWS computers. The long term goal is to create a new database in Microsoft SQL server, which can be run on FWS computers. This might be a simple prigram switch or might involve a database redesign. Other updates on the progress of this endeavor can be read in the BOEM bimonthly progress reports for this project or the [updates tab](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/updates?pli=1) on the website.

### **1. Collect datasets at large**   
This is an ongoing effort by FWS, NOAA, and BOEM. A progress table can be seen [here](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/progress-table)

### **2. Quality control data**  
This will most likely be simple data checks (e.g. do species codes match those in the catalog) - data should be cleaned by the data provider before submission

### **3. Enter data into the database**  
There are several tables in the seabird schema; however, the most important ones are the observations and transect tables. 
Track data is stored in the QGIS spatial portion of PostgreSQL. 

### **4. Check database integrity**  
After adding data, you should verify that the joins were successful.

### **5. Submit data to users and archives**  
- NODC ([National Oceanographic Data Center](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/))  
  - *Process:* Once the data has been entered into the NWASC database, the data are sent to the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) to be archived. A past submission can be seen [here](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OAS/prd/accession/0115356) (accessions_id: 0115356). Datasets that are already in the NODC can be found in the [DataSets\_in_\NODC.xlsx file](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/archived-in-nodc).
    - All data-object-tables from the database need to be extracted and combined in one flat 'csv' file, [see old](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0070/0115356/1.1/data/0-data/seabird_data_archive_NODC_30Dec2013.csv)  
    - Prepare a file with column descriptions, [see old](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0070/0115356/1.1/data/0-data/seabird_data_structure_NODC_30Dec2013.csv)  
    - Prepare a FGDC record metadata file, [see old](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0070/0115356/1.1/data/0-data/Atlantic%20Offshore%20Seabird%20Dataset%20Catalog_NODC%20Metadata_FGDC.xml)  
    - Report needs to be in 'pdf' format.  
    - The data should be submitted using the submission [website](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/s2n/). 
  - *Scripts needed:* create_vw_data_output_nodc_dec2013 (SQL file to create NODC view excluding some datasets that shouldn't be public or were not designed for bird counts)
- OBIS ([Ocean Biogreographic Information System](http://www.iobis.org/))  
- BISON ([Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation](http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/#home))
- AKN ([Avian Knowledge Network](http://www.avianknowledge.net/))  
- NOAA [avian modeling effort](http://portal.midatlanticocean.org/static/data_manager/metadata/html/avian_metadata.html) 
  - The NOAA Biogeography branch uses all of the data in the catalog in a predictive distribution model. 
  This involves processing all of the seabird data into segments. See segmentation script. 

### **6. Handle data requests**  
Anyone can request the data. These requests will most likely be specific and require querying the database
