Data use agreement for the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog
===

*This Data Use Agreement has been modeled from the Data Use Agreement of the Biodiversity 
Information Serving Our Nation (BISON), the previous user agreement for the Offshore Atlantic 
Seabird Compendium drafted by USGS, and the USFWS Woodcock survey.  This Data Use policy provides 
guidance to data users of the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog.*   

**Purpose**:  Several bureaus within the Department of Interior compiled available 
information from seabird observation datasets from the Northwest Atlantic into a 
single relational database, with the goal of conducting research and informing 
coastal and offshore planning activities. The cooperators were the Bureau of Ocean 
Energy Management (BOEM), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and the U.S. 
Geological Survey (USGS). The resulting product is the Northwest Atlantic Seabird 
Catalog (NWASC), formerly the Atlantic Offshore Seabird Compendium.    

**Procedures**:  Individuals and agencies have put forth a substantial 
effort to document which seabird surveys have occurred in the Northwest Atlantic, 
and have requested data from data providers to add to the catalog. This effort is 
ongoing. We created a [data submission guidance document](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/Submission%20Guidelines%20for%20NWASC.rmd) 
to streamline import but 
still conduct basic quality control and formatting of the data for import.   

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are committed to providing free and open 
access to species occurrence and abundance data.  Datasets included in the 
Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog (NWASC) are provided by individuals and 
agencies, each with their own methods, often for different purposes, and 
should be treated as such.  Therefore, using combined data as provided 
through the NWASC requires agreement with the following:  

**Data Use Agreements:**

1.	The USFWS shall not be held liable for improper or incorrect use of the data described and/or contained herein. 
2.	I understand that even though the following data have undergone substantial editing and review prior to posting, errors or inaccuracies may still exist in the data.  Thus, this data should be regarded as provisional since subsequent reviews may result in significant revisions to the data. These data have been processed successfully on computer systems within the Division of Migratory Bird Management (DMBM), U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (USFWS), however no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding the accuracy or utility of the data on any other system or for general or scientific purposes, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any such warranty. This disclaimer applies both to individual use of the data and aggregate use of the data. I will employ these data at my own risk.  
3.	If errors are found, I will report them to the data manager.
4.	I will pay careful attention to the contents of the metadata files associated with these data.
5.	I acknowledge that the USFWS strongly recommends that these data are directly acquired from a USFWS, DMBM source, and not indirectly through other sources which may have changed the data in some way. The only other acceptable aggregated source would be through the National Oceanographic Data Center / National Centers for Environmental Information (NODC/NCEI), yet these data are only archived yearly so version number should be noted. 
6.	I understand that there are inherent biases in these datasets, such that a map of the observations does not represent true distribution of marine animals. These biases include but are not limited to:
  - Uneven distribution of survey effort geographically and through seasons & years.
  - Variations in methodology such that not all species were recorded during every survey; some surveys were conducted from “ships of opportunity” or focused on specific taxa.
  - Observer and observation bias: no effort was made in most survey methods to estimate detection probabilities.
  - For some surveys the observations are pooled across multiple observers on the transect line while for others the effort is broken out for each observer.
  - For some surveys, observations from multiple platforms might overlap in time and space when methodology and/or technology were being tested. 
  - If survey effort was not recorded or supplied but the transect design was supplied, an estimated effort could be made for the survey, yet this is only a representation of what might have occurred.
  - If the data provider did not list the definitions of the species codes used and we share an overlapping code, there could be unrecognizable errors in the data. 
Wherever possible, these biases and/or method variations are noted in the metadata for each dataset.
7.	I will respect restrictions of access to sensitive data.
8.	I understand that some data contributors do not wish to be contacted regarding the information they have provided. I will check with the data manager first for additional information. 
9.	Professional Courtesy:
  - I recognize that although these data are being provided at no charge, the collection of these data was expensive, and if I pursue research that uses someone’s dataset in its entirety, I will contact that person and offer co-authorship where appropriate.
  - I will notify the database manager and/or the data owner or contributor if publications or policy reports are produced that use their data substantially.
  - I will not redistribute these data as my own or without credit.
10.	When citing the data, I will comply with additional terms and conditions of use set by the data publisher. Where these exist they will be available through the metadata associated with the data. Data publishers may require additional attribution of specific collections within their institution. I agree to cite the dataset(s) used and credit sources following these examples:
  - For multiple datasets, list the datasets in the work (such as in a table in the supplemental information), and cite:
    - US Fish and Wildlife Service, US Department of Interior. Accessed through US Department of Interior, Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog, Version [version number]. [Access date].
    - If the data are accessed through the NODC/NCEI portal: 
Sussman, A. and US DOI; US Geological Survey (2014). Atlantic Offshore Seabird Dataset Catalog, Atlantic Coast and Outer Continental Shelf, from 1938-01-01 to 2013-12-31 (NODC Accession 0115356). Version 1.1. National Oceanographic Data Center, NOAA. Dataset. [access date]
  - For citing a specific dataset:
    - Use the provider defined citation 
    - If a citation is not provided:
[Data Provider]. [Dataset name]. Accessed through US Department of Interior, Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog, 
Version [version number]. [Access date]
