**Guidelines for submitting data to the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog (NWASC)**   
===

1)	The data must be accompanied by a metadata file or documentation (e.g., a final report or proposed work/design for the project) describing how the data was collected and describing column names, measurement units, and ranges of acceptable inputs.   
* a.	Metadata for spatial data should conform to FGDC [guidelines](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards)  
* b.	At a minimum metadata for bird observations should contain the following fields  
   + i.	Source of data including contact information  
   + ii.	Dates inclusive of all surveys submitted  
   + iii.	Type of platform used for observations: boat, aircraft, camera, fixed point ground survey, area-wide ground survey  
   + iv.	Preferred citation if data are made public  
   + v.	The link to the survey report if the report is published online  
   + vi.	Definition of fields transferred to NWASC including range of values and units  
   + vii.	Please list the survey method: Christmas bird count, bycatch, continuous time strip, discrete time horizon, discrete time strip, general observation, or targeted species survey.   
   + viii.	Please indicate whether the survey was derived effort, an original general observation, or original transect.  
  
2)	If species codes were used, please include documentation describing the codes. For example, a separate column or spreadsheet defining that COTE means common tern.  A list of our [species codes can be found on our GitHub webpage](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/Species_Codes.rmd). We do accept observations for other marine fauna and boats. ITIS codes are preferred.   
  
3)	The observation data should be accompanied by a transect design and, if available, an effort file. Effort files are usually the locations where the survey actually took place since sometimes an observation might not exactly be on the transect line or there might be a break in effort when an observer is not observing on a transect line. The effort helps clarify if there were no birds were seen in an area verses if the observer was not observing for a segment on a transect line.   
+ a.	Please provide this information in WGS84 datum or provide information on projection. Coordinates would be in decimal degrees (not UTMs)  
+ b.	Please provide beginning and ending points of transects  
+ c.	If effort is available please indicate the start and stop locations of when the observer was on or off effort and if an observation was off of the transect line (such as if observations were made in transit to the transect line)  
  
4)	Data should be provided in a commonly accessible formats; delimited with delimiter specified (e.g., ‘,’ ‘:’ ‘;’ ‘|’, tab, space), MS Excel, MS Access database, ArcGIS shapefile or geodatabase). Field descriptions can be found at the end of this document.   
  
5)	All data should have undergone quality checking and be free of errors (e.g., typos, date errors, mislabeled transects)  
  
6)	Data should not require any additional processing by our staff; such as if we had to back calculate a provider defined count per unit effort to define observation count.   
  
7)	No personal information (e.g., phone number or email) should be included in the data file (but see metadata requirements).  Any personally identifiable information will be stripped from the data before being loaded into the NWASC. Observer codes or initials are OK.  
  
8)	Data should be submitted via email to Kaycee Coleman, kaycee_coleman@fws.gov. If the attachment is too large to transfer via email, we can discuss further options.

**Dataset table:**

field name | desciption    
----------|----------  
survey_type_cd (text)| The platform on which the survey occurred (e.g. boat (b), aircraft (a), camera (c), fixed point ground survey (f), area-wide ground survey (g))  
survey_method_cd (text)| The method of how the survey was conducted (e.g. Christmas bird count (cbc), bycatch (byc), continuous time strip (cts), discrete time horizon (dth), discrete time strip (dts), general observation (go), or targeted species survey (tss))  
dataset_type_cd (text)| The design of the survey (e.g. derived effort (de), original general observation (go), or original transect (ot))  
survey_width (number)| Planned width of survey in meters  
survey_description (text)| Metadata for this dataset, such as summary of survey methods and acceptable ranges of each parameter (example: The Atlantic Marine Assessment Program for Protected Species (AMAPPS) Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) fall 2014 dataset was conducted during the day between 10/6-10/22/2014 and ranges from Cape Canaveral, FL to the Maine/Canada border. Transects are located at 5’ (~5 nautical mile) intervals at the 1’ and 6’ minute latitude lines and extend from the coast to 30  meter depths or a maximum of 50 nautical miles offshore. Surveys are conducted on Kodiak aircrafts by teams of two observers, flying at 200 feet above ground at 110 knots. All seabirds, marine mammals, turtles, boats, and balloons within 400 meters of the observer are recorded. Distance from the observer to the animal is recorded where 0 = <200 meters or unknown, 1 = 0-100 m, 2 = 100-200 m, and 3 = >200 m which is off of the transect line being surveyed. Bird behavior is recorded as sitting or flying.  The number of individuals is recorded for each species. Weather condition is also recorded on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). Time is recorded in seconds from midnight and should not be converted.) 
dataset_citation (text)| How you would like users to cite your data.  
dataset_report (text)| A link to where the report on how the data were collected can be found online, in case the user needs further   information (e.g. [NMFS AMAPPS Annual Report](http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/psb/AMAPPS/docs/NMFS_AMAPPS_2011_annual_report_final_BOEM.pdf))
