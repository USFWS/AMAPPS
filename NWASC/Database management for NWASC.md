Database management for the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog 
===

For FWS personnel: Details can be found at the FWS NWASC [website](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/). 
Currently the working version of the database is in Microsoft SQL server and can only be accessed from FWS computers. Other updates on the progress of this endeavor can be read in the BOEM bimonthly progress reports for this project or the [updates tab](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/updates?pli=1) on the website.

### **1. Collect datasets**   
This is an ongoing effort by FWS, NOAA, and BOEM. A progress table can be seen [here](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/progress-table) or in the BOEM reports. When a data set is recieved, put the data in a new folder named after the data set and year(s) surveyed. If that data set is part of a larger effort there should be a parent folder for that survey name and then folders for each data set within that parent folder. Please include a text document listing a point of contact for that data set and any other pertinent information. If you are able to obtain a report for that data set from the provider, include that in the folder as well. Please see the [data submission guidelines](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/Submission%20Guidelines%20for%20NWASC.md) for details about what should be requested. 

In the database there is a dataset table; all the metadata should be entered here. An example of the metadata that you need from the data provider can be found in the [submission guidelines](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/Submission%20Guidelines%20for%20NWASC.md). There is also a column for the report url if there is one. The point of contact needs to be added to the lu_people table with their work email address and if this address is still active. Sometimes the data are older and no one is maintaining them anymore, those contacts would be inactive - as in there is no one to contact if you have questions about these data. This NWASC table generation [sql script](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/sql/create_NWASC_tables.sql) should explain how to add people and other non-spatial data into the database. Please maintain this script going forward so that all the non-spatial data can be reloaded in case of an extreme error. 

### **2. Quality control data**  
While the data should be cleaned by the data provider before submission, this isn't always the case. This will most likely be simple data checks (e.g. do species codes match those in the catalog, are the gps coordinates in latitude and longitude units, are certain data columns such as the count column a number, etc.); however, more effort is sometimes required. For datasets where there is a clear survey design, yet the provider cannot supply one, an estimated track effort file needs to be made in order to segment that data for NOAA. Sometimes the lines are simple and straight forward, but if it is more complex, try to use an average of the data to create a line between commonly used start and stop points. Please keep records of this process in the [NWASC/cleaning](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/tree/master/NWASC/cleaning) folder under a unique name and year folder within the name folder. Each unique survey should have it's own dataset id. 

### **3. Enter data into the database**  
There are several tables in the seabird schema; however, the most important ones are the observations, dataset, track, and transect tables. The dataset table is where most of the metadata for that dataset is gathered, most of this information can be found in the dataset report (if there is one). Again, this NWASC table generation [sql script](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/sql/create_NWASC_tables.sql) should explain how to add non-spatial data to the database. As for the spatial data, this will have to be done using [OGR2OGR](https://alastaira.wordpress.com/ogr2ogr-patterns-for-sql-server/) in the terminal window or for smaller qantities of data could be done in R. These are also methods on how to data out of the database and put it into different data types. See [data requests](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/tree/master/NWASC/data_requests) and [sql views](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/tree/master/NWASC/sql) for examples, some of the data requests have OGR2OGR text in the comments in the beginning of the R code.  

### **4. Check database integrity**  
After adding data, you should verify that the joins were successful and no existing data was altered in the process.  

Additionally, there are times when data users might bring errors to your attention. When this happens please update the data in the database, add comments where changes have happened, and change the dataset version to the next version up (e.g. version 1 to version 2) in the dataset table. Currently there is a running list of revisions in this [sql code](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/blob/master/NWASC/sql/dataset_revisions.sql). These revisions do not list revisions made from version 1 (PostgreSQL maintained by USGS) to version 2 (MSSQL server maintained by USFWS). To learn more about these revisions see bimonthly and annual BOEM reports in the MB SeaDuck/seabird_database/documentation/Reports folder.  

### **5. Submit data to users and archives**  
-  NCEI (NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information)/ NODC ([National Oceanographic Data Center](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/))  
  - *Process:* Once the data has been entered into the NWASC database, the data are sent to the  NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) (Formerly NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center - NODC) to be archived. A past submission can be seen [here](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OAS/prd/accession/0115356) (accessions_id: 0115356). Datasets that are already in the NODC can be found in the [DataSets in NODC file](https://sites.google.com/a/fws.gov/nwasc/archived-in-nodc).
    - All data-object-tables from the database need to be extracted and combined in one flat 'csv' file, [see old](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0070/0115356/1.1/data/0-data/seabird_data_archive_NODC_30Dec2013.csv)  
    - Prepare a file with column descriptions, [see old](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0070/0115356/1.1/data/0-data/seabird_data_structure_NODC_30Dec2013.csv)  
    - Prepare a FGDC record metadata file, [see old](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0070/0115356/1.1/data/0-data/Atlantic%20Offshore%20Seabird%20Dataset%20Catalog_NODC%20Metadata_FGDC.xml)  
    - Report needs to be in 'pdf' format.  
    - The data should be submitted using the submission [website](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/s2n/). 
  - *Scripts needed:* create_vw_data_output_nodc_dec2013 (SQL file to create NODC view excluding some datasets that shouldn't be public or were not designed for bird counts)
- OBIS ([Ocean Biogreographic Information System](http://www.iobis.org/))  
- BISON ([Biodiversity Information Serving Our Nation](http://bison.usgs.ornl.gov/#home))
  - Conversations about desired format are ongoing, but this will most likely be a segmented product like the one supplied to NOAA, instead of the raw data. We will nail down the details submitting AMAPPS data first, and then move to this larger database.  
- AKN ([Avian Knowledge Network](http://www.avianknowledge.net/))  
  - Conversations about desired format are ongoing, but this will most likely be a segmented product like the one supplied to NOAA, instead of the raw data  
- NOAA [avian modeling effort](http://portal.midatlanticocean.org/static/data_manager/metadata/html/avian_metadata.html) 
  - The NOAA Biogeography branch uses all of the data in the catalog in a predictive distribution model. 
  This involves processing all of the seabird data into segments. ([See segmentation script](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/tree/master/NWASC/Segmentation)). 

### **6. Handle data requests**  
Anyone can request the data. These requests will most likely be specific and require querying the database.  Make sure that you take note of the share level of the data when filling the request.    
- These can be found in the "data_requests" and "data_sent" folder in the "seabird_database" folder and are also maintained on [here](https://github.com/USFWS/AMAPPS/tree/master/NWASC/data_requests). Please remember to upload your scripts to GitHub and add this request to the request table in the MSSQL server database.
- They should include:  
  - a description of the request  
  - the date of the request 
  - the status of the request (filled/not yet filled, if filled the date should be included)
  - the code used to query the data   
  - the exported file that is sent to the requester
