**Guidelines for submitting data to the Northwest Atlantic Seabird Catalog (NWASC)**   
===

1. The data must be accompanied by a metadata file or some sort of documentation describing how the data was collected and describing 
variable names  
    a. Metadata for spatial data should conform to FGDC [guidelines](https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/geospatial-metadata-standards)  
    b. At a minimum metadata for bird observations should contain the following fields  
        i. Source of data including contact information  
        ii. Dates inclusive of all surveys submitted  
        iii. Type of platform used for observations (boat, aircraft, etc.)  
        iv. Preferred citation if data are made public  
        v. Definition of fields transferred to NWASC including range of values  
2. The observation data should be accompanied by a transect/ effort file  
    a. Please provide this information in WGS84 datum or provide information on projection. Coordinates would be in decimal degrees 
    (not UTMs)  
    b. Please provide beginning and ending points of transects  
3. Ideally the observation data would be in an easily accessible format that can be read into R (e.g., .txt, .csv, MS Excel, MS Access 
database, ArcGIS shapefile). Track (effort) files will be stored in a geographic information system part of the database; therefor if 
possible ArcGIS shapefiles would be appreciated.  
    a. Descriptions of variables that are included in the observation table of the [database](http://www.nodc.noaa.gov/archive/arc0070/0115356/1.1/data/0-data/seabird_data_structure_NODC_30Dec2013.csv)  
4. The data should be free of basic errors (e.g., typos, date errors, mislabeled transects)  
5. The data would not require any processing on our end, such as if we had to back calculate a provider defined count per unit 
effort to define observation count.  
6. No personal information (e.g., phone number or email) should be included in the data file (but see metadata requirements).  
    a. Observer codes are OK.  
    b. Any personally identifiable information will be stripped from the data before being loaded into the NWASC.  
7. Data should be submitted via email to Kaycee Coleman, kaycee_coleman@fws.gov. If the attachment is too large to transfer via 
email, we can discuss further options.
